# Description
A small informational and entertaining website made for HackUNT 2022 where the theme was space travel. Our team decided to create a website that had elements of interactivity to present information about space and specifically Mars, as it is the most reasonable planet for us to travel to at the moment.

The website features a 3D interactive planet with a real map of mars, space facts, and an interactive game where you can learn about space travel by talking to an astronaut. 

The website was created using ThreeJS, ReactJS and NextJS.

# In Action!
